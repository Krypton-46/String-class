# String-class
This repository contains a custom implementation of a String class using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The class provides basic string handling functionalities, with more functions to be added over time.
Welcome to the Custom String Class project! This repository contains an implementation of a String class developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project aims to provide a flexible and extendable String class with various string manipulation functions.

Features
Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes OOP principles to encapsulate string operations within a dedicated class.
Custom Implementation: A personalized approach to string handling, allowing for tailored functionalities and optimizations.
Extensibility: Designed to be easily extendable with new string functions being added over time.
Current Functions
The Custom String class currently includes the following functions:

Constructor: Initializes a new instance of the String class.
Copy Constructor: Initializes a new String as a copy of another.
isEmpty: Tells whether the string is empty or not.
Destructor: Cleans up resources used by the String class.
Planned Features
Future updates will include additional string manipulation functions such as:

Concatenation
Substring extraction
Comparison
Search and replace
And more...
Implementation Details
The Custom String Class is implemented in C++ and showcases various OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
